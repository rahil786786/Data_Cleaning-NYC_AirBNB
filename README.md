# 🗽 NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning & EDA

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on transforming the **NYC Airbnb dataset** into a clean and analysis-ready format.  
The raw dataset contained several data quality challenges such as:  
- Missing values  
- Duplicates  
- Inconsistent formats  
- Outliers  

Through systematic **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, the dataset was refined to uncover meaningful insights about Airbnb listings in New York City.

## ⚙️ Steps Involved  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values in *name, host_name, reviews_per_month,* and *last_review*  
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant records  
- Standardized inconsistent data formats for uniformity  
- Treated outliers in numerical columns (e.g., price) to avoid skewed analysis  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

#### 🔹 Univariate Analysis  
- Distribution of neighbourhood groups  
- Top 10 neighbourhoods and most active hosts  
- Room type preferences and proportions  

#### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis  
- Relationship between neighbourhood group and average price  
- Price variations across different room types  
- Host activity levels across neighbourhoods  

***

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Certain **neighbourhood groups dominate Airbnb listings** in NYC.  
- **Room type** strongly influences price distribution, with private rooms and entire homes showing clear distinctions.  
- A few **top hosts control a majority of listings**.  
- Extreme price outliers heavily skew averages, making preprocessing essential.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python: *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis techniques  

***

## 🎯 Outcome  
The project resulted in a **clean, structured, and reliable dataset** that supports:  
- Deeper exploratory analysis  
- Better visualizations and storytelling  
- Data-driven decision-making for Airbnb market insights  
- A solid foundation for future modeling or predictive analysis

Would you like me to also design this README with **badges (e.g., Python, Pandas, Jupyter)** and a **table of contents for navigation** so it looks even more professional on GitHub?
