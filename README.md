🗽 NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning & EDA
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on preparing the NYC Airbnb dataset for meaningful analysis.
The raw dataset contained challenges such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and outliers.
Through systematic data cleaning and preprocessing steps, the dataset was transformed into a structured, reliable, and analysis-ready format. Along with cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns and insights.

⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values in name, host_name, reviews_per_month, and last_review.
Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.
Corrected inconsistent data formats for better uniformity.
Dealt with outliers in numerical variables to avoid skewed analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Univariate Analysis
Distribution of neighbourhood groups
Top 10 neighbourhoods and host names
Room type preferences and their proportions
🔹 Bivariate Analysis
Relationship between neighbourhood groups and average prices
Price variations across different room types
Host activity levels across neighbourhoods
📊 Key Insights
Certain neighbourhood groups dominate Airbnb listings in NYC.
Price distribution shows significant variation depending on room type and location.
A few hosts account for a large portion of listings.
Outliers in price heavily affect average values, so handling them was crucial.
🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🎯 Outcome
The final dataset is now clean, structured, and reliable, enabling deeper exploration and insight generation.
This cleaned dataset serves as a solid foundation for further visualization, modeling, or business decision-making.
